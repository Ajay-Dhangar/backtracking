      <h1>Backtracking</h1>
      <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
      <p>
        The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of option, and
        you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a
        new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
        choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and until you reach a
        final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is
        a goal state; If you didn't, it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has
        some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it maybe that the leaves
        are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and
        you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrackto continue the search
        for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the
        next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke
        the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If
        you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to
        be found.
      </p>

      <p class="example-1">This needs an example</p>
      <p class="img"></p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
      </ol>

          In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract
          model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also
          a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data
          structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree
          data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree
          searching.)

      <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
      <fieldset>
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) { 
              if n is a leaf node { 
                if the leaf is a goal node, 
                return true else return false 
              } else { 
                for each child c of n {
                  if solve(c) 
                  succeeds, return true 
                } 
                return false 
              } 
            }

        <p class="ex-3">
        Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
        essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that
        means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes
        on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If
        solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal
        node.
      </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        How does this work?
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ex-4">
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines
      </p>
      <fieldset class="fie-1">
        <pre class="pre-1">
            for each child c of n { 
              if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
            } 
            return false
        </pre
        >
      </fieldset>
      <p class="ab">
        Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines
      </p>
       <fieldset class="fie-1">
        <pre class="pre-2">
            if n is a leaf node { 
              if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
              else return false 
            }

        The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
      </p>
      <h2>
        To search a tree:
      </h2>
      <ol class="ol-1">
        <li class="li-1">If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <li class="li-1">Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
