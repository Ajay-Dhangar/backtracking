      <h1>Backtracking</h1>
      <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
      <p>
        The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of option, and
        you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a
        new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
        choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and until you reach a
        final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is
        a goal state; If you didn't, it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has
        some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it maybe that the leaves
        are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and
        you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrackto continue the search
        for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the
        next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke
        the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If
        you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to
        be found.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="example-1">This needs an example</p>
      <p class="img"></p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="ex-2">
        <p class="ex-3">
          In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract
          model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is
          also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data
          structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual
          tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree
          searching.)

      <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
      <fieldset>
        <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) { 
              if n is a leaf node { 
                if the leaf is a goal node, 
                return true else return false 
              } else { 
                for each child c of n {
                  if solve(c) 
                  succeeds, return true 
                } 
                return false 
              } 
            }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <div class="ex-2">
        <p class="ex-3">
          Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
          essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that
          means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the
          nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is
          solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n
          to any goal node.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>How does this work?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ex-4">
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path
        to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is
        solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above
        code, this is done by the lines
      </p>
      <fieldset class="fie-1">
        <pre class="pre-1">
            for each child c of n { 
              if solve(c) succeeds, return true 
            } 
            return false
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <p class="ab">
        Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf
        node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal
        node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this
        is done by the lines
      </p>
      <fieldset class="fie-1">
        <pre class="pre-2">
            if n is a leaf node { 
              if the leaf is a goal node, return true 
              else return false 
            }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <p>
        The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should
        understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
      </p>
      <h2>To search a tree:</h2>
      <ol class="ol-1">
        <li class="li-1">
          If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.
        </li>
        <li class="li-1">
          Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal
          node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
      <p>
        Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
        algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how
        your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly
        language.
      </p>
      <fieldset class="fie-3">
        <pre class="pre-3">
            boolean solve(Node n) { 
              put node n on the stack; 
              while the stack is not empty { 
                if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf { 
                  if it is a goal node, return true 
                  else pop it off the stack 
                } 
                else { 
                  if the node at the top of the stack has untried children 
                  push the next untried child onto the stack 
                  else pop the node off the stack 
                } 
                  return false 
                }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <p>
        Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack
        are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and
        these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the
        stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed
        from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among
        their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the
        stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution
        to the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
        form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path
        information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive
        calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node
        at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or
        storing it in an array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print
        (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:
      </p>
      <fieldset class="fie-3">
        <pre class="pre-3">
            boolean solve(Node n) { 
              if n is a leaf node { 
                if the leaf is a goal node { 
                  print n return true 
                } 
                else return false 
                } 
                else { 
                  for each child c of n { 
                    if solve(c) succeeds { 
                      print n return true 
                    } 
                  } 
                  return false 
                } 
              }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
      <p>
        All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple,
        but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up
        with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be
        complex:
      </p>
      <p>
        for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
        problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried
        in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node
        is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method</strong> (or you could
        even call it <strong> isLeaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate
        all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for
        each node on the current path, which of its children have been tried
        already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made
        this look simple, by just saying
        <strong>for each child c of n.</strong> In reality, it may be difficult
        to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no
        obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can
        represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of
        that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a
        legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of
        which ones you've already examined?
      </p>
      <p>
        The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
        have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is,
        when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children.
        As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty,
        there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure."
        This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried,
        if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering,
        and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child
        to try next.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might be able to number the
        <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order.
        Then, if you have just tried <strong>child k</strong>, you know that you
        have already tried children 1 through k-1, and you have not yet tried
        children <strong> k+1 </strong>through <strong> n. </strong> Or, if you
        are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try
        <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child
        yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a
        maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right
        <strong> (or perhaps north, east, south, west). </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a
        node. <strong>In the chess game example,</strong> you might number your
        pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical
        order; but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these
        must also be ordered. You can probably find some way to order the
        children of a node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you should
        use it; but if it is too cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list
        of untried children.
      </p>
      <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
      <p>
        For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking,
        which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of
        tree, a binary tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is
        designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero,
        one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are
        referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are
        reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no
        cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of
        a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal
        node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which
        we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
      <fieldset class="fie-4">
        <pre class="pre-4">
            public class BinaryTree { 
              BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
              BinaryTree rightChild = null; 
              boolean isGoalNode = false; String name; 
              BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) { 
                this.name = name; 
                leftChild = left; 
                rightChild = right; 
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode; 
              } 
            }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <p>
        Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a
        method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.
      </p>
      <fieldset class="fie-4">
        <pre class="pre-4">
            static BinaryTree makeTree() { 
              BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f; 
              c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false); 
              d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false); 
              e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true); 
              f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false); 
              a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false); 
              b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false); 
              root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false); 
              return root; 
          }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
      <fieldset class="fie-5">
        <pre class="pre-5">
            public static void main(String args[]) { 
              BinaryTree tree = makeTree(); 
              System.out.println(solvable(tree)); 
            }
        </pre>
      </fieldset>
      <p>
        And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the
        binary tree by finding a goal node.
      </p>
