    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>

    <p>
      The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of option, and you
      must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new
      set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice
      you made. This procedure is repeated over and until you reach a final
      state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal
      state; If you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some
      good leaves and some bad leaves, though it maybe that the leaves are all
      good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning
      with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep
      this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrackto continue the search for
      a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next
      option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the
      choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end
      up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>

    <p class="example-1">This needs an example</p>
    <p class="img"></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
      <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
      <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
      <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
      <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
      <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
      <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>

      In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model
      of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data
      structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to
      tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data
      structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
    <fieldset>
      <pre>
    boolean solve(Node n) { 
      if n is a leaf node { 
        if the leaf is a goal node, 
        return true else return false 
      } else { 
        for each child c of n {
          if solve(c) 
          succeeds, return true 
        } 
        return false 
      } 
    }
  </pre
    >
    </fieldset>
    <p class="ex-2">Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
